# Hyperion Guard

**A pre-trade firewall for autonomous trading agents, with its kill switch on Arc.**

AI agents are being handed wallets and trading keys, and they fail in ways
people don't. They get prompt-injected, fat-finger a price, or loop on an
order. Nothing stands between the model's decision and the market. Hyperion
Guard does:

- **Every order is checked before it goes out:**
  - order size;
  - the day's total;
  - a price collar against an independent reference;
  - a rate throttle;
  - the kill switch.
- **The agent's limits and its kill switch live on Arc**, set by the agent's
  human owner. The agent's own key can't loosen them. A guardian, such as a
  monitoring bot, can stop the agent in one transaction that finalises in
  under a second. Only the owner can bring it back.
- **Every decision is a signed verdict,** approved or not. A
  `GuardedExecutor` wallet on Arc will only execute a call that carries a
  live approval for exactly that call. So a rejected, replayed, altered or
  pre-kill approval fails on-chain, not just in the Guard's opinion.
- **The Guard's record is anchored on Arc** as Merkle roots over contiguous
  ranges, so anyone holding a verdict can prove it's in the record, and gaps
  can't be hidden.
- **Agents pay per check** in USDC through Circle Gateway Nanopayments
  (x402): $0.001 a check.

The checks are modelled on Hyperion's Rust pre-trade risk controller
([`src/risk/controller.rs`](../src/risk/controller.rs)): kill switch first,
then size, collar and throttle, with a daily notional cap in place of its
position limit, since the Guard sees orders, not fills.

## Try it in one command

With [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) and Python 3.11+:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Aditya-galaxy/hyperion.git && cd hyperion
python3 -m venv guard/service/.venv && guard/service/.venv/bin/pip install -e guard/service
bash guard/demo/local.sh
```

It starts a local chain, deploys the contracts, and runs six scenes:

| Scene | The Guard says | On-chain |
|---|---|---|
| A normal order | approved | executed |
| A prompt-injected $39,000 order | rejected: `order_notional` | forced through anyway, `VerdictRejected(NotApproved)` |
| A price 7% over the market | rejected: `price_collar` | nothing sent |
| A burst of orders | rejected: `rate_limit` after 5 a minute | nothing sent |
| The guardian kills the agent | rejected: `killed` | an approval issued *before* the kill reverts, `VerdictRejected(Killed)` |
| Anchor the record | root of verdicts 1–11 | `VerdictsAnchored` event |

Only the normal order reaches the venue.

| Part | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `HyperionGuard` | [`contracts/src/HyperionGuard.sol`](contracts/src/HyperionGuard.sol) | Agent registry: owner, guardian, policy, kill switch. EIP-712 verdict checks. Contiguous Merkle anchors. |
| `GuardedExecutor` | [`contracts/src/GuardedExecutor.sol`](contracts/src/GuardedExecutor.sol) | An agent's trading wallet. Runs a call only with a live approval bound to the chain, the wallet, the target, the calldata, the notional and the nonce. The owner can always withdraw. |
| Guard service | [`service/hyperion_guard`](service/hyperion_guard) | Reads the agent's record from Arc **on every check**, runs the checks, signs the verdict, logs it. Fails closed if Arc can't be read or there's no fresh reference price. |
| Paywall | [`paywall/server.ts`](paywall/server.ts) | Circle Gateway Nanopayments middleware in front of the service. `/v1/check` is paid. Health, agent lookups and verdict proofs are free. |
| Demo | [`demo`](demo) | The six scenes above, on a local chain or Arc testnet. |

### The policy

Set by the owner and stored on-chain. Amounts are in USDC's 6-decimal units.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `maxOrderNotional` | largest single order |
| `maxDailyNotional` | total approved per UTC day |
| `collarBps` | how far a buy may pay above, or a sell take below, the reference price |
| `maxOrdersPerMinute` | throttle on approved orders |

A policy change or a revive bumps `policyVersion`. That kills every
outstanding verdict: nothing approved under the old rules survives.

### Rejection codes

These are carried in the signed verdict's `reason`:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | approved |
| 1 | killed |
| 2 | over the per-order limit |
| 3 | over the daily limit |
| 4 | outside the price collar |
| 5 | rate limited |
| 6 | no fresh reference price |
| 7 | unknown agent |
| 8 | malformed order |

## API

`POST /v1/check` (paid):

```json
{
  "agent": "0x…",
  "order": {"symbol": "BTC-USD", "side": "buy", "qty": "0.005", "price": "65100"},
  "client_order_id": "abc-1",
  "executor": {"address": "0x…", "target": "0x…", "data": "0x…", "nonce": 0}
}
```

- **With `executor`**, the verdict's `orderHash` is exactly
  `GuardedExecutor.orderHash(target, data, notional, nonce)`, ready to pass
  to `execute`.
- **Without it**, the order hash covers the order's canonical fields and
  `client_order_id`. That's for venues that aren't on-chain.

The response contains:

- the `verdict` struct;
- its EIP-712 `signature` and `digest`;
- `approved`, `reason` and a plain-English `explanation`;
- the computed `notional` and the `reference_price`.

Free endpoints:

- `GET /v1/health`
- `GET /v1/agents/{address}`
- `GET /v1/verdicts?agent=`
- `GET /v1/verdicts/{seq}`, which includes the Merkle proof once the verdict is anchored

## Deploying on Arc

Use an encrypted keystore (`cast wallet import guard-owner --interactive`),
never a private key on the command line.

```bash
cd guard/contracts
GUARD_SIGNER=0x<signer address> forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url arc_testnet --account guard-owner --broadcast
GUARD=0x<guard> AGENT=0x<agent> GUARDIAN=0x<guardian> forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DemoSetup \
  --rpc-url arc_testnet --account guard-owner --broadcast
```

For mainnet, use `--rpc-url arc_mainnet` (chain 5042). Gas is paid in USDC,
and a full deployment costs cents.

To run the service, see `hyperion-guard --help` for the environment variables:

```bash
hyperion-guard serve
```

To anchor new verdicts:

```bash
hyperion-guard anchor
```

To run the paywall, from `guard/paywall`:

```bash
SELLER_ADDRESS=0x… npm start
```

## What it doesn't do (yet)

- **The notional is declared, not decoded.** `GuardedExecutor` can't read a
  trade size out of arbitrary calldata. The agent declares it and the Guard
  checks the declared figure. The owner's target allow-list bounds what a lie
  could reach. Venue-specific decoders are the next step.
- **One signer.** The Guard's signing key is a hot key on the service. The
  contract lets the admin rotate it, and rotating kills every outstanding
  verdict. A threshold of signers is future work.
- **Usage is in memory.** The daily total and throttle are rebuilt from the
  ledger on restart, but aren't shared between replicas. Run one instance, or
  put a shared store behind it.
- **Reference prices.** Pyth Hermes (it needs an API key since 2026-08-26) or
  fixed prices for demos. On-chain oracles on Arc (Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone)
  are the next source to add.
- **Not audited.** Research code: tested (23 contract tests including a fuzz
  test, 29 service tests, cross-language signature vectors), but not
  reviewed by a third party. Don't trust it with money you can't lose.
